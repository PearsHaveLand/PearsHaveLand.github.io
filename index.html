 	<h2 class="contentheader">Personal Life and Interests:</h2>
  	<p>In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with computers and working on simple
      programming projects. I always have a new idea for a project, and am eager
      to start coding it up. Many of my freelance projects are hosted on my GitHub page,
      linked below.</p>
  		<p>But not all of my interests are based in information technology. I also
        enjoy hiking, gardening, and running long distances. Currently, I've
        caught plant fever and have been collecting more succulents than I can
        fit in my apartment. Pictures to come.</p>
  		<p>Before entering the computer science curriculum, I worked towards
        becoming a cartoonist. I still practice art as a hobby and I hope to
        showcase some of my works online in the future. Lately, I've been into
        tabletop games like D&D and Warhammer 40,000. So most of my recent
        artistic endeavors involve painting miniatures for gameplay.</p>
  		<p>I plan on using this site to highlight my strengths as a worker as well
        as my interests as a person.
      For example, I coded up the green progress bar on the top of this page to
      refresh my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It expands as you scroll
      further down the page, but there's not much to scroll through right now.
      But if you make your browser window <i>really tiny</i>, you can see it in
      all its glory!</p>
  		<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
