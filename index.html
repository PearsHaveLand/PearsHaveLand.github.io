	<h2>Personal Life and Interests:</h2>
		<p>In my free time, I enjoy building and maintaining computers, as well as exploring the applications of different operating systems.
		But not all of my interests are based in information technology. I also enjoy hiking, woodworking, and running long distances. </p>
		<p>Before entering the computer science curriculum, I worked towards becoming a cartoonist. I still practice art as a hobby and I hope to showcase some of my works online in the future.</p>
		<p>I plan on using this site to highlight my strengths as a worker as well as my interests as a person.</p>
		<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
