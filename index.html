      <h2>Personal Life and Interests:</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with computers and working on simple
        programming projects. I always have a new idea for a project, and am eager
        to start coding it up. Many of my freelance projects are hosted on my GitHub page,
        linked below. I also have links to a few small projects for web dev practice.</p>
        enjoy hiking, gardening, and running long distances. Currently, I've
        <p>But not all of my interests are based in information technology. I also
        caught plant fever and have been collecting more succulents than I can
        fit in my apartment. Pictures to come.</p>
        <p>Before entering the computer science curriculum, I worked towards
        becoming a cartoonist. I still practice art as a hobby and I hope to
        showcase some of my works online in the future. Lately, I've been into
        tabletop games like D&D and Warhammer 40,000. So most of my recent
        artistic endeavors involve painting miniatures for gameplay.</p>
        <p>I plan on using this site to highlight my strengths as a worker as well
        as my interests as a person.
        <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
